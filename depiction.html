		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Seng is a sleek and highly customisable replacement for your iOS 8 &amp; 9 app switcher and control center, providing 2 core features:</p>
	</div>
	<img style="margin-top: 20px;" src="http://chewitt.me/SengFiles/MultiCentre.png" alt="" width="80px" height="80px" />
	<div style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 5px;">Multi Center</div>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The Multi Center is at the heart of seng, fusing the app switcher and control center in a revolutionary way.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img id="mcScreens" src="http://chewitt.me/SengFiles/Screens/1.jpg" alt="" width="50%" height="auto" /></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Seng provides unprecedented levels of customisation, allowing you to position control sections wherever you like.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>With twelve default sections and full support for CCLoader the potential is amazing. Scroll view sections allow you to pack even more functionality into a compact area, and you can intelligently hide the AirPlay and media sections.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>You can use slick gestures to activate the Multi Center and it is compatible with a large number of popular tweaks such as FlipControlCenter, Polus, CCSettings and QuickActivator.</p>

	<div style="font-size: 25px;">Hot Corners</div>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Seng's Hot Corners add a whole new level of user interaction to iOS.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://chewitt.me/SengFiles/QuickSwitcher.gif" alt="" width="50%" height="auto" /></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The Quick Switcher allows you to quickly and easily switch between your most recent applications with a simple swipe gesture.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It has been designed to feel at home with the standard OS and quickly becomes an essential aspect of your experience.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The swipe to close gesture is also a great addition to iOS, allowing a fast way to dismiss the open app.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>And performing the same gesture on your home screen will lock your device; no need to have to reach for those buttons any more!</p>
	</div>
	<img style="margin-top: 20px;" src="http://chewitt.me/SengFiles/Other.png" alt="" width="80px" height="80px" />
	<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 25px;">And More...</div>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">
		<p>These core features are supported by a number of further options to tweak the appearance of seng, a great feature allowing you to assign actions (including quit all apps, lock, shut down &amp; more) to occur when the home screen app card is dismissed and (on iOS 9) the ability to swipe in from the left and right edges of the screen to switch app.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>All of seng's features are designed to adapt to your device, with support for all iPhone screen sizes and orientations.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>And seng is localised for a huge number of languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Portugese, Hebrew and Arabic among others. Thank you to all the translators who helped make this possible.</p>

	<div style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 10px;">
		<p>Compatible with all iPhones and iPods running iOS 8 &amp; 9.</p>
		<p>Seng has been tested with a large number of tweaks, but there is still potential for compatibility issues. If you experience any crashes this is the most likely reason, get in touch and I can try to resolve it.</p>
		<p>On iOS 9: BioProtect is incompatible, Tage <i>may</i> cause problems and tweaks which affect the new switcher (e.g. SwitcherTweak) will likely cause issues. If using Mikoto you need to latest beta version.</p>
